jQuery 1.4.x or later is required.

Steps:
1 - Put AjaxFactory.init() on the top of your script.
2 - Then you need to wrap every AJAX request with the addRequest() function, like this: AjaxFactory.addRequest("my_unique_id",$.post(....))
3 - Then, if you wanna kill all pending requests, just execute AjaxFactory.killAllRequests()
4 - Or kill a single request with AjaxFactory.killRequest("my_unique_id")

That's all folks!
