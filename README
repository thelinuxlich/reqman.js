jQuery 1.4.x or later is required.

Steps:
- Load reqman.js
- Optionally, set a callback to execute before or after adding/removing a request(see the docs folder)
- Wrap every AJAX request with the add() function, like this: RQ.add($.get(....),"optional_id")
- Then, if you wanna kill all pending requests, just execute RQ.killAll()
- Or kill a single request with RQ.kill("optional_id")

That's all folks! (The docs folder contains more details!)
